This directory contains all of the ARM computational kernels used the paper "Fast
Sparse ConvNets" submitted to CVPR 2020.

spmm-NxM-[scalar,neonfma].c - Sparse Matrix Multiplication with an unroll of N
in the HW dimension and a block size of M in the channel output dimension.

dwconv-KxKsSpP-[scalar,neonfma].c - Depthwise Convolution with a filter of KxK,
a stride of S and symmetric padding of P.

gavgpool-[scalar,neon]-xN.c - Global average pooling unrolled over N rows.

conv-3x3s2p1c3x4-[scalar,neonfma]-KxK - Full 3x3 stride 2 convolution with
HWC input and CHW output.  Operates on 3 input channels (only supported) and 4
output channels in the inner loop.  Produces a KxK output.
